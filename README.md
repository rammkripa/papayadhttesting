## Current Issues

### Cosmetic

1. PapayaFile instead of commandline parameters
2. Use inbuilt Sequentials and stuff instead of from scratch model class

### Networking

1. Keep devices on network to train more models
2. Share parameters by splitting for bigger models
3. Test across computers on same/diff network


### Modelling

1. Port TensorFlow
2. Train more epochs using built-in function Easy too many loops
